//express works on the idea of middlewares means that we have a request and some middlewares in between to handle the reqeust and then
//we can send the response.

//we also has a next method in middlware , if we execute next then the request will be passes to next middlware

//if we send the res with res.send() and the we call next then we will get the error as we cant send more than one response 
//for one reqest.

//in middleware we also have paths optional argument to only use middlware that has the matching path.
